## introduction :

Greench helps keep your plants healthy and green. To do this, our device heats up when needed and tells you when he needs to water. Plus, it automatically provides the brightness you need and tells you when to turn it off.

## How it works ?

We have several sensors that detect humidity, temperature, light and the distance to the plant. If the brightness is too low the UV lamps will come on. If it is too cold the heating will come on. If the weather is not too hot and there is not too much light (so not a lot of sun), and the humidity of the earth is low, at this time the LED will light up to signal the lack of water.
